**Project summary**

The primary aims of this study characterized and compared the bacterial communities (microbiota) from the i) cloaca of nesting sea turtles; ii) sand within and surrounding the nests and iii) hatched and unhatched eggshells from two important species, the loggerhead (_Caretta caretta_) and green (_Chelonia mydas_) turtles. Samples were collected from nests in Fort Lauderdale and Hillsboro beaches in Broward County, Florida, where local nesting consisted of approximately 95% loggerhead, 5% green and 1% leatherback turtles (_Dermochelys coriacea_). Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V3-V4 region amplicons was performed on 27 cloaca, 54 sand, and 162 egg samples. This study provides new insights into the bacterial communities associated with egg failure in sea turtle nests and unveiled information about the impacts the environment has on bacterial introduction.
